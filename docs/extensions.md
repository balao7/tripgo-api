# Extensions

Right after signing up, the API will serve results for regions and transport providers that publish their data as Open Data and which have already been connected to our system.

The TripGo API can be extended in the following ways:

1. Unlock transport modes, regions and real-time data from services that require you to first accept their terms or acquire API credentials.
2. Add new transport modes through our TSP Connectors (coming soon).
3. Add new regions through our Region Connectors (coming soon).
