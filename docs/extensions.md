# Extensions

Right after signing up, the API will serve results for regions and transport providers that publish their data as Open Data and which have already been connected to our system.

The TripGo API can be extended in the following ways:

1. Add transport modes (or regions) that require API keys, such as Uber, Lyft or certain public transport providers that require you to sign up with them first.
2. Add new transport modes through our TSP Connectors (coming soon).
3. Add new regions through our Region Connectors (coming soon).
